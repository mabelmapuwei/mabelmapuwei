## Hi, I am MabelğŸ‘‹

<!--
**mabelmapuwei/mabelmapuwei** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

With 23 years of experience in systems analysis, design, and supportâ€”mainly within banking ITâ€”Iâ€™ve built a strong track record of delivering reliable, high-impact solutions that support core financial operations. My background includes working across the full software development lifecycle, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and supporting mission-critical banking applications.
Recently, I completed a Masterâ€™s degree in Information Technology, majoring in Big Data Science, to deepen my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling. This transition reflects my passion for data-driven insights and the growing need for organizations to make smarter, evidence-based decisions.
I bring hands-on experience with key tools and technologies, including:
â€¢	SQL for data querying and transformation
â€¢	Excel for advanced data analysis and modeling
â€¢	Power BI for interactive dashboards and business intelligence reporting
â€¢	Python and R for data wrangling, analysis, and machine learning
â€¢	Certified in Microsoft Power BI
Now pivoting into data analytics and business intelligence, I'm focused on applying my industry knowledge and technical skills to solve real-world business problems, uncover patterns, and deliver actionable insights.
I'm always open to connecting with fellow professionals and exploring new opportunities in data analytics, BI, and data science.
